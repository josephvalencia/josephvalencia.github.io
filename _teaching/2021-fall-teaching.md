Engineering 100
======

Fall Term 2021. I served as a teaching assistant for "Engineering for Global Development", a class taught by Prof. Nordica MacCarty as one section of "Engineering 100 : The Oregon State Engineering Student". This was the first year after the school of Engineering restructured its first-year orientation series to combine students from all prospective majors. Under Prof. MacCarty's supervision, I developed the new curriculum for hands-on studio activities and instructed the students during these studios. Activities included measuring the efficiency of various wood-burning stove models, building water filters using household items, and programming LEGO Mindstorm robots using Python. Throughout the term, we also discussed the ways that various engineering specialties can contribute to international development and humanitarian projects.
