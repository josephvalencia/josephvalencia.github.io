Welcome to my website! I am Joseph, a graduate student at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. I am currently working towards my PhD in computer science under the supervision of [Professor David Hendrix](http://hendrixlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/about.html). Since joining OSU in 2019, I have worked on developing deep learning systems that will help power scientific discovery in the field of molecular biology. I am always interested in hearing about job opportunities and chances to collaborate with others, so please reach out if you would like to talk!

My Research
======
Broadly, I build machine learning systems with the aim of discovering new biological rules at the molecular level. At the moment, I am focusing on translational regulation -- the ability of cells to tune the levels of available proteins during translation. I am developing a deep learning classifier to distinguish messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA and incorporating the mechanics of translation as a biologically meaningful inductive bias. At the same time, I am investigating interpretive techniques to mine the learned representations for insight into the sequence patterns governing translational regulation. A primer on translational regulation and the current state of my ongoing research can be found in my [Qualifying Exam](), which I passed in October 2021. 

Biological data can present unique challenges to machine learning. Biological sequences like DNA, RNA, and proteins are inherently discrete. Many neural network explanation methods were developed for computer vision, where images are naturally a continuous space. The field of natural language processing bears some similarity to biological sequences -- text is also composed of discrete words arranged into a specific sequence ordering. However, nucleotide sequences can be many times larger than natural language sentences, while the character vocabulary is much sparser.

Background and Personal Interests
======
I am originally from Colorado, and before coming to Oregon State, I graduated from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma with a B.S. in CS. In my spare time, music is one of my biggest passions : I enjoy playing the guitar, singing, and have even composed a few songs of my own. I try to lift weights regularly, am learning to play tennis, and enjoy hiking and skiing in the outdoors of both the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.
